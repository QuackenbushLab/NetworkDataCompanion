# NetSciDataCompanion

An R library for preprocessing data at the Network Science Lab.

# Installing

To install and use the library:
- first install.packages("devtools")
- then install the library with devtools::install() (provided you are at the project folder)
- load the library in your code with library(NetSciDataCompanion)

An example is provided that explores the functionality of the library.

# Building

We are using roxygen2 for this. It seems that at the moment, the only thing we need to do is to call devtools::document() and the package will be updated.
