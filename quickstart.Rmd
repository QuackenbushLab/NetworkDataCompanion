# About NetworkDataCompanion

The `NetworkDataCompanion` R package is a collection of utilities for wrangling TCGA data. While it was developed to serve as the engine behind `tcga-data-nf`, the Nextflow workflow presented in @fanfani2024reproducible, `NetworkDataCompanion` is a stand-alone package that can be used independently. The primary goal of the package is to provide version-controlled and unit-tested functions for common tasks involved in network analyses of TCGA data, such as calculating gene-level summary measures of methylation data, normalizing RNA-seq data, and integrating multiple omics by mapping various file identifiers back to TCGA barcodes. 

While none of these tasks are particularly complex, `NetworkDataCompanion` is motivated by their ubiquity. Beyond its role in `tcga-data-nf`, this package aims to:

  1. Reduce "re-work" by eliminating the need for everyone to write a few lines of code to, e.g., map TCGA identifiers in their own scripts
  
  2. Reduce the error-prone nature of the type of coding described in (1) by offering a centralized, maintained, version-controlled, and unit-tested resource for general use. 

# Preparing the workspace

The first step is to install `NetworkDataCompanion` from GitHub using the `devtools` library and the `install_github` function. Here, we have suppressed messages as there are quite a few. 

```{R, message=F}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("QuackenbushLab/NetworkDataCompanion")
```

Once you have installed the package, load the library into your workspace. 

```{R, message=F}
library(NetworkDataCompanion)
```

# Download demonstration data

Once you have installed the package, you next need to download the data used in this quickstart.

These data are from the TCGA COAD analysis presented in @fanfani2024reproducible and can be downloaded from the Harvard Dataverse here: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MCSSYJ 

For the script below to work, please place the `tcga-data-supplement` directory in the same working directory as this RMarkdown. Alternatively, you can modify the `datapath` variable below.

For reference on the source of the data, the full workflow of the COAD analysis is available at https://github.com/QuackenbushLab/tcga-data-supplement/.

Data acknowledgement: These data were generated by the TCGA Research Network: https://www.cancer.gov/tcga.

# Working with the NetworkDataCompanion Object

The most simple way to get started with `NetworkDataCompanion` is to create an oject using the `CreateNetworkDataCompanionObject` function with an empty argument. Because it is a Companion, we like to call it `my_friend`: 

```{R}
my_friend = NetworkDataCompanion::CreateNetworkDataCompanionObject()
```

There are a few built-in attributes that will be accessible to the functions of the Companion:

```{R}
ls(my_friend)
```

Of these, `gene_mapping` and `sample_type_mapping` are loaded with the empty constructor. For the other attributes, we must supply a patient data file and TCGA cancer type. For the COAD example, we can use the following:

```{R}
datapath = "tcga-data-supplement/data/processed/batch-coad-subtype-20240510/tcga_coad_cms1/"
patient_data = paste0(datapath,"data_download/clinical/clinical_patient_coad.csv")
```

We input these to the constructor to load the relevant data into the Companion object: 

```{R}
my_coad_friend = NetworkDataCompanion::CreateNetworkDataCompanionObject(clinical_patient_file = patient_data,project_name = "COAD")
```

Now, we can see the other attributes. The project name helps us keep track of which cancer we are working with:

```{R}
my_coad_friend$project_name
```

The clinical patient data stores TCGA barcodes and a range of other patient-level information:

```{R}
my_coad_friend$clinical_patient_data[1:5,1:5]
```
The `TCGA_purities` attribute contains the information about tumor purity for each sample. Because these TCGA data are from bulk tissue, there may be some non-tumor cells in the each sample as well. Higher purity samples will give more accurate depiction of the tumor microenvironment and the user may wish to filter based on purity.

```{R}
head(my_coad_friend$TCGA_purities)
```

# NetworkDataCompanion Functions

The `tcga-data-nf` workflow retrieves five different data types: clinical data, expression, mutations, copy number variation (CNV) data, and methylation. The clinical data is used in the Companion object constructor. The other data types can be wrangled with the Companion member functions.

First, we define paths to the data:

```{R}
exp_datapath = paste0(datapath,"data_download/recount3/tcga_coad_cms1.rds") 
mut_datapath = paste0(datapath,"data_download/mutations/tcga_coad_cms1_mutations.txt") 
mut_pivot_datapath = paste0(datapath, "data_download/mutations/tcga_coad_cms1_mutations_pivot.csv")
cnv_datapath = paste0(datapath, "data_download/cnv/tcga_coad_cms1.csv")
meth_datapath = paste0(datapath, "data_download/methylation/tcga_coad_cms1_methylations.txt")
```

## Functions for working with expression

The functions for working with gene expression in NetworkDataCompanion are generally wrappers around the functionality of the `RangedSummarizedExperiment` objects produced by `recount3`. For documentation on this type of object, please see ***.

First, we read in the expression data, which is downloaded as both an .rds file and as a .csv file in the Download phase of the `tcga-data-nf` pipeline. The .rds file contains the `RangedSummarizedExperiment` object, so this is the downloaded file that we work with here. The .csv file is provided for convenience if you have other applications that do not require the `RangedSummarizedExperiment`.

```{R}
expr_data = readRDS(exp_datapath)
expr_data
```

To extract metadata from the `RangedSummarizedExperiment`, we use the `extractSampleAndGeneInfo` method. This produces two dataframes: `rds_gene_info`, which stores gene identifiers and other gene-level metadata, and `rds_sample_info`, which stores sample identifiers such as TCGA barcodes, patient characteristics, and sample characteristics.

<!-- The function `extractSampleAndGeneInfo` provides a way to get metadata from the RangedSummarizedExperiment object that stores the expression data download. -->

```{R}
expr_metadata = my_friend$extractSampleAndGeneInfo(expr_data)
ls(expr_metadata)
```


For example, if we wish to get the gene names and Ensembl IDs for the first five genes in the dataset, we can use:

```{R}
expr_metadata$rds_gene_info %>%
  dplyr::select(gene_id,gene_name) %>%
  slice_head(n=5)
```

Similarly, let's get the TCGA barcode and vital status of the patients who provided the first 5 samples:

```{R}
expr_metadata$rds_sample_info %>%
  dplyr::select(tcga.tcga_barcode,tcga.gdc_cases.diagnoses.vital_status) %>%
  slice_head(n=5)
```

To get information about a set of genes, `NetworkDataCompanion` provides a wrapper function `getGeneInfo`. 

```{R}
my_friend$getGeneInfo(c("BRCA1","BRCA2"))
```

These results can also be searched by Ensemble or Entrez gene IDs. The Ensemble IDs for BRCA1 are ENSG00000012048 and ENSG00000139618, respectively:

```{R}
my_friend$getGeneInfo(c("ENSG00000012048","ENSG00000139618"))
```

And the Entrez IDs for BRCA1 and BRCA2 are 672 and 675.

```{R}
my_friend$getGeneInfo(c(672, 675))
```

### Converting between gene identifiers

There are many, many tools for converting between gene identifiers, and ours has neither bells nor whistles. Our tool simply uses the hardcode Gencode v26 mapping found in the `inst/extdata/gen_v26_mapping_w_entrez.csv` file. A more sophisticated tool may better fit your use case; however, we provide this functionality as we used it in the `tcga-data-nf` pipeline.

```{R}
my_friend$geneNameToENSG(c("BRCA1","BRCA2"))
my_friend$geneNameToEntrez(c("BRCA1","BRCA2"))
```

Sometimes, the gene conversion will yield a one-to-many mapping. For this reason, it is important to use proper merging operations (`merge` in base R; the `left_join`,`right_join`,`inner_join`,`full_join` functions from `dplyr`) when annotating these conversions back to a dataset.

```{R}
my_friend$geneNameToENSG("NOTCH4")
```


### Normalizing RNAseq data

`NetworkDataCompanion` provides a wrapper for logTPM RNAseq normalization functions from `recount3`. A pseudocount is added in the calculation. The input to this function is the `RangedSummarizedExperiment` object:


```{R}
logTPM = my_friend$logTPMNormalization(expr_data)
ls(logTPM)
```

The three items returned include the transformed counts, which have been processed by `recount3::transform_counts`, the logTPM (corresponding to log(TPM+1) with the pseudocount), the TPM (which is provided for use cases related to filtering by TPM, for example, if one would like to do something like remove genes with TPM < 1 in more than 20% of the samples). Rows are indexed by Ensembl gene ID. Let's look at the values for BRCA1 (ENSG00000012048.20):

```{R}
brca1_counts=logTPM$counts[which(rownames(logTPM$counts)=="ENSG00000012048.20"),1:3]
brca1_TPM=logTPM$TPM[which(rownames(logTPM$TPM)=="ENSG00000012048.20"),1:3]
brca1_logTPM=logTPM$logTPM[which(rownames(logTPM$logTPM)=="ENSG00000012048.20"),1:3]

brca1_counts
brca1_TPM
brca1_logTPM
```

There is also a wrapper for logCPM normalization. This is based on the `edgeR` recipe for TMM normalization; see the package documentation for more details. Again, a pseudocount is added in the calculation. Unlike `logTPMNormalization`, which uses the `RangedSummarizedExperiment` as input, `logCPMNormalization` uses a matrix or data frame of raw expression counts as input. This can be accessed using the `assay` function of the `RangedSummarizedExperiment`.

```{R}
logCPM = my_friend$logCPMNormalization(assay(expr_data))
ls(logCPM)
```

Here, counts refer to the raw counts in the `RangedSummarizedExperiment` object. Note that, because these counts have not been transformed with `recount3::transform_counts`, they will not be coherent with the `counts` attribute of `logTPMNormalization`. This is expected behavior.

We again investigate the values for BRCA1:


```{R}
brca1_counts=logCPM$counts[which(rownames(logCPM$counts)=="ENSG00000012048.20"),1:3]
brca1_CPM=logCPM$CPM[which(rownames(logCPM$CPM)=="ENSG00000012048.20"),1:3]
brca1_logCPM=logCPM$logCPM[which(rownames(logCPM$logCPM)=="ENSG00000012048.20"),1:3]

brca1_counts
brca1_CPM
brca1_logCPM
```


<!-- A function for normalization takes a RangedSummarizedExperiment as input and returns three matrices: raw counts, TPM. and log(TPM + 1). -->

<!-- ```{R} -->
<!-- # Normalize data -->
<!-- test_exp_all = my_friend$logTPMNormalization(test_exp_rds) -->
<!-- test_exp_count = test_exp_all$counts -->
<!-- test_exp_tpm = test_exp_all$TPM -->
<!-- test_exp_logtpm = test_exp_all$logTPM -->
<!-- ``` -->
